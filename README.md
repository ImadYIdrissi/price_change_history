# What is this repo

An attempt to perform OCR on images to collect data from images that look like tabluar-images.

The images I used are from a game, and I thought it could be fun to trace the prices from this game on csv files without using things like cheat engines etc...  

## How to use

1. Create a python virtual environment with `pyenv` or `venv` etc... I won't go into how to do that here. Use python 3.12.2.
2. Install python packages, run this command

   ```bash
   cd price_change_history
   ```

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txr
   ```

3. Run `python runes_oop_ocr.py`
